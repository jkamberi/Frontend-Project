        <img src="assets/alex.jpg" alt="me">
        <p>Alexandros Kontogiannis is a full time working student. He is studying informatics and is working as an IT at an accounting company. He does prefer programming than IT. It is really exhausting because both his job and his studies are really time consuming but he believes it will be worth it in the long future, and he was able to buy a big motorcyrcle for traveling and fun. Seems like it is already worth it! He can go from point A to point B whenever and however he wants and that is helpful in combining work and university. He has also started going to the gym few months ago and he regrets not starting sooner! The results in physique, mental stamina and way of thinking are remarkable!</p>
